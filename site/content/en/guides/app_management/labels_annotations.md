# Setting Labels and Annotations

## Motivation

Users may want to define a common set of labels or annotations for all the Resource in a project.

- Identify the Resources within a project by querying their labels.
- Set metadata for all Resources within a project (e.g. environment=test).
- Copy or Fork an existing Project and add or change labels and annotations.

See [Bases and Variations]() for more details on Copying Projects.
